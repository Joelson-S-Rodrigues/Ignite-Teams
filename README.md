## 🎨 Layout

Layout developed by [Rodrigo Gonçalves ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rodrigo-goncalves-santana/) and [Millena Kupsinskü Martins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/millenakmartins/)

## 👏 Learning and more Implementations

- I learned and implemented tweaks in import paths, decreasing the size with aliases configured in Babel and tsConfig.
- I learned and implemented the creation of a default and configured theme in Styled Components.
- I learned about how route navigation works in react native navigation and implemented Stack Navigator type routes.
- I learned how to save local data on the cell phone and implemented the functionalities in the storage folder.
- I implemented the screen to create teams and configured it to adjust when adding people, being able to exclude the team.
